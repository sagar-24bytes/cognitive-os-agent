# Personal Cognitive OS

A goal-driven voice-based AI agent that plans, executes, remembers, and learns from user interactions to manage and organize a personal computer.

The system:
- understands user intent via LLMs
- decomposes goals into plans
- executes actions using local tools
- stores long-term memory
- reflects on outcomes to improve future behavior

This is not a chatbot.  
This is an autonomous agent architecture.
